                <p>Our moon, Earth's sole satellite, hangs about 238,000 miles away, influencing tides, stabilizing our climate, and dazzling us with its ever-changing phases. It's a rocky world, scarred by ancient impacts, with a mysterious dark side we're still exploring. Humans have even left their footprints there!</p>
